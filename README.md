## Event-Driven Programming

Hi, welcome to the repository. This serves as my playground and storage area for practicing coding related to the Event-Driven Programming Subject. It was initially meant for private use but through the progess of the subject, we were introduced to Github as well, hence its change of visibility into public as an academic requirement. The formal preparations I submit are found in [BookIn_WFANet](BookIn_WFANet). Thank you! :>
